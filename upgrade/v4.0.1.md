# IRIS Hub Upgrade v4.0.1

## Upgrade Proposal

We are prepared to upgrade the IRIS Hub based upon

- Version: `v4.0.1`
- Commit hash: `1f2335f0492c0ee1ce1f98f485cc6567123cba53`;
- Chain Halt at Block Height: `29271900`;

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Vote

```bash
iris tx gov vote <proposal-id> <yes|no|no_with_veto|abstain> --chain-id irishub-1 --fees 0.3iris --from <MyWallet>
```

### 2. Upgrade Nodes

If the **Upgrade Proposal** successfully passes, the IRIS Hub will be halted automatically at around UTC `2025-03-20 06:00:00Z`, then we can upgrade all the irishub nodes right away.

**Note: All nodes have to be upgraded, whether it is a validator node, a seed node or a full node.**

The specific steps are as follows:

```bash
# 1. Compile and install the new version, go 1.22.7+ is required
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/irishub
cd irishub && git checkout v4.0.1
make install

# 2. Check the version number
iris version --long
commit: 1f2335f0492c0ee1ce1f98f485cc6567123cba53
cosmos_sdk_version: v0.50.11-lsm
go: go version go1.23.7 linux/amd64
name: iris
server_name: iris
version: 4.0.1

# 3. Close the old software
kill <iris-pid>

# 4. Restart
iris start --home=<path-to-your-home>
```

### 3. Wait for Blocks

When the voting power of validators that have completed the upgrade exceeds 67%, irishub can resume producing blocks, and the upgrade is completed.

# IRIS Hub Upgrade v3.0.0

## Upgrade Proposal

We are prepared to upgrade the IRIS Hub based upon

- Version: `v3.0.0`
- Commit hash: `TODO`;
- Chain Halt at Block Height: `25006118`;

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Vote

```bash
iris tx gov vote <proposal-id> <yes|no|no_with_veto|abstain> --chain-id irishub-1 --fees 0.3iris --from <MyWallet>
```

### 2. Upgrade Nodes

If the **Upgrade Proposal** successfully passes, the IRIS Hub will be halted automatically at around UTC `2024-05-20 05:30:00Z`, so we can upgrade all the irishub nodes right away.

**Note: All nodes have to be upgraded, whether it is a validator node, a seed node or a full node.**

The specific steps are as follows:

```bash
# 1. Compile and install the new version, go 1.21+ is required
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/irishub
cd irishub && git checkout v3.0.0
make install

# 2. Check the version number
iris version --long
name: iris
server_name: iris
version: v3.0.0
commit: TODO
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.21 darwin/amd64

# 3. Close the old software
kill -9 <iris-pid>

# 4. Restart
iris start --home=<path-to-your-home>
```

**Note**: If after restarting irishub using the v3.0.0 client, the following error occurs:

```text
Failed to load latest version: failed to load store: initial version set to XXXXX, but found earlier version XXXXX.
```

Please follow these steps to correct your data:

1. Download and install the fix program

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/iavl
cd iavl && git checkout support-remove
make install
```

2. Check for erroneous data

```bash
iaviewer versions <path-to-your-home>/data/application.db s/k:icahost/
```

If the above wrong version number is output in the execution result of the above command, please continue to step 3. If there is no version number output, your data may have been damaged. It is recommended to use the snapshot data of other nodes to repair it.

3. Repair data

```bash
iaviewer remove <path-to-your-home>/data/application.db s/k:icahost/
```

4. Restart irishub using the v3.0.0 client

### 3. Wait for Blocks

When the voting power of validators that have completed the upgrade exceeds 67%, irishub can resume producing blocks, and the upgrade is completed.

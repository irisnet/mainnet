# IRIS Hub Upgrade v2.1.0

## Upgrade Proposal

We are prepared to upgrade the IRIS Hub based upon

- Version: `v2.1.0`
- Commit hash: `39fdf6c85a5fca711e2aa7282f574a7f365c875e`;
- Chain Halt at Block Height: `23170081`;

## Upgrade Process

### 1. Vote

```bash
iris tx gov vote <proposal-id> <yes|no|no_with_veto|abstain> --chain-id irishub-1 --fees 0.3iris --from <MyWallet>
```

### 2. Upgrade Nodes

If the **Upgrade Proposal** successfully passes, the IRIS Hub will be halted automatically at around UTC `2024-01-08 05:30:00Z`, so we can upgrade all the irishub nodes right away.

**Note: All nodes have to be upgraded, whether it is a validator node, a seed node or a full node.**

The specific steps are as follows:

```bash
# 1. Compile and install the new version, go 1.19+ is required
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/irishub
cd irishub && git checkout v2.1.0
make install

# 2. Check the version number
iris version --long
name: iris
server_name: iris
version: v2.1.0
commit: 39fdf6c85a5fca711e2aa7282f574a7f365c875e
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.19 darwin/amd64

# 3. Close the old software
kill -9 <iris-pid>

# 4. Restart
iris start --home=<path-to-your-home>
```

### 3. Wait for Blocks

When the voting power of validators that have completed the upgrade exceeds 67%, irishub can resume producing blocks, and the upgrade is completed.

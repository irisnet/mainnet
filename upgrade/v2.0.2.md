## Upgrade Proposal

We are prepared to upgrade the IRIS Hub based upon

- Version: `v2.0.2`

## Upgrade Process

**Note that the patch is NOT state-machine breaking. The patch can be deployed individually by validators and full nodes without a chain-halt upgrade and should be applied as soon as possible.**

The specific steps are as follows:

```bash
# 1. Compile and install the new version, go 1.18+ is required
git clone https://github.com/irisnet/irishub
cd irishub && git checkout v2.0.2
make install

# 2. Check the version number
iris version --long
name: iris
server_name: iris
version: v2.0.2
commit: 
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.18 darwin/amd64

# 3. Close the old software
kill -9 <iris-pid>

# 4. Restart
iris start --home=<path-to-your-home>
```
